# KubeOnAzure
This is a playground of how to integrate Kubernetes with Azure services.  

The demos in this repo have either been delivered as talks at conferences or delivered to customers through Microsoft.

## Globally Distributed Kubernetes
Based on a talk I gave at the Docker London meetup in November 2017 at Skillsmatter.  You can watch the talk [here](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/11140-containerisation-on-azure#video), and the walkthrough is in the [GloballyDistributed](https://github.com/justindavies/KubeOnAzure/tree/master/GloballyDistributed) directory
